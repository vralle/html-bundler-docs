An HTML bundler is a tool that streamlines the creation of complete web pages by processing HTML templates with linked assets.
It automates the resolving of dependencies, compiles templates, and ensures that the output HTML contains correct output URLs.

## What does an HTML bundler do?

- **Treats HTML as an entry point**: Initiates the build process from HTML, allowing direct inclusion of source asset files like scripts and styles.
- **Processes HTML templates**: Supports various template engines such as EJS, Handlebars, Nunjucks, Pug, and more.
- **Handles dependencies**: Resolves source files referenced in HTML, such as SCSS, JS, images, updating their references with correct output URLs.
- **Inlines resources**: Provides options to inline JavaScript, CSS, and images.
- **Generates preload tags**: Automatically creates `<link rel="preload">` tags for assets to enhance resource loading.
- **Generates integrity attributes**:  Adds `integrity` attributes to `<link>` and `<script>` tags to ensure resource integrity and security.
- **Generates favicons**: Creates favicons of various sizes for different platforms and injects them into the HTML.

An HTML bundler is a tool that processes and optimizes HTML files by bundling
related assets such as CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, and other resources.
It simplifies the development workflow by resolving dependencies,
injecting resources, and optimizing files for production.

The HTML bundler plugin automate the process of managing and injecting assets into HTML files.

## What does an HTML bundler do?

- Processes HTML files – Parses and transforms HTML files based on project configurations.
- Injects assets dynamically – Automatically inserts `<script>`, `<link />`, and other tags for bundled CSS, JS, and images.
- Optimizes assets – Minifies, compresses, and hashes file names for better performance.
- Handles dependencies – Resolves imported modules, like JavaScript and CSS, within HTML.
- Supports template engines – Can compile and bundle files using template engines like Pug, EJS, etc.
- Improves caching – Generates versioned asset filenames for cache-busting.

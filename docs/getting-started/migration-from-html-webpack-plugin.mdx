## Migration from HTML Webpack Plugin

For years, configuring [html-webpack-plugin][html-webpack-plugin] for multiple pages was a hassle.
Each page required manually defining the `chunks` option to reference JavaScript files from the entry configuration,
leading to a frustrating "chunks hell" configuration.

Also, `html-webpack-plugin` alone is not enough. Rendering an HTML template containing JS, CSS, SVG, images and other assets requires additional "crutches" as plugins for `html-webpack-plugin`, as well additional plugins and loaders.

Thus, this plugin requires a whole bunch of additional plugins and loaders, many of which have not been supported for a long time, which limits the use of the plugin itself.


To solve this and many other problems,
was created `html-bundler-webpack-plugin` â€” an "all-in-one" solution that simplifies HTML handling
and automatically manages asset dependencies with ease.

# Third-party

The third-party plugins not maintained by the HtmlBundlerPlugin.
It potentially does not have the same support, security policy or license as [Build-in Plugins](/Plugins/build-in).

You can create own plugin using the [plugin hooks](/hooks-and-callbacks).
As a reference plugin, you can use the [FaviconsBundlerPlugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/html-bundler-webpack-plugin/tree/master/plugins/favicons-bundler-plugin).

If you have a useful plugin, create a PR with the link to you plugin.

The plugin name must end with `-bundler-plugin`, e.g. `hello-world-bundler-plugin`.

_Currently there are no plugins yet. Be the first to create one._

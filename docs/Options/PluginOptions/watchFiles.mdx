# Watch files

Option: `watchFiles`

Type:

```ts
type WatchFiles = {
  paths?: Array<string>;
  includes?: Array<RegExp>;
  excludes?: Array<RegExp>;
};
```

Default:

```js
watchFiles: {
  paths: ['./src'],
  includes: [/\.(html|ejs|eta)$/],
  excludes: [
    /[\\/](node_modules|dist|test)$/, // ignore standard project dirs
    /[\\/]\..+$/, // ignore hidden dirs and files, e.g.: .git, .idea, .gitignore, etc.
    /package(?:-lock)*\.json$/, // ignore npm files
    /webpack\.(.+)\.js$/, // ignore Webpack config files
    /\.(je?pg|png|ico|webp|svg|woff2?|ttf|otf|eot)$/, // exclude binary assets
  ],
}
```

Allows to configure paths and files to watch file changes for rebuild in `watch` or `serv` mode.

### Properties

- `paths` - A list of relative or absolute paths to directories where should be watched `includes`.\
The watching path for each template defined in the entry will be autodetect as the first level subdirectory of the template relative to the project's root path.
E.g., the template `./src/views/index.html` has the watching path of `./src`.

- `includes` - Watch the files specified in `paths`, except `excludes`, that match the regular expressions.
Defaults, are watched only files that match the [`test`](#option-test) plugin option.

- `excludes` - Exclude the specified paths or files, that match the regular expressions.

This options does not override the default values, but extends them.

For example, all source files are in the `./src` directory,
while some partials included in a template are in `./vendor/` directory, then add it to the `paths`:

```js
watchFiles: {
  paths: ['vendor'],
},
```

If you want watch changes in some special files used in your template that are only loaded through the template engine,
add them to the `includes` property:

```js
watchFiles: {
  paths: ['vendor'],
  includes: [
    /data\.(js|json)$/,
  ],
},
```

To exclude watching of files defined in `paths` and `includes`, you can use the `excludes` option.
This option has the priority over paths and files.

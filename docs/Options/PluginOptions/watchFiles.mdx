# Watch files

Option: `watchFiles`

Type:

```ts
type WatchFiles = {
  paths?: Array<string>;
  includes?: Array<RegExp>;
  excludes?: Array<RegExp>;
};
```

Default:

```js
watchFiles: {
  paths: ['./src'],
  includes: [/\.(html|ejs|eta)$/],
  excludes: [
    /[\\/](node_modules|dist|test)$/, // ignore standard project dirs
    /[\\/]\..+$/, // ignore hidden dirs and files, e.g.: .git, .idea, .gitignore, etc.
    /package(?:-lock)*\.json$/, // ignore npm files
    /webpack\.(.+)\.js$/, // ignore Webpack config files
    /\.(je?pg|png|ico|webp|svg|woff2?|ttf|otf|eot)$/, // exclude binary assets
  ],
}
```

The `watchFiles` option allow specify additional files (besides the default ones) to rebuild
when they change during development (with `webpack --serv` or `webpack --watch`).

Allows to configure paths and files to watch file changes for rebuild in `watch` or `serv` mode.

### Properties

- `paths` - A list of relative or absolute paths to directories where should be watched `includes`.\
The watching path for each template defined in the entry will be autodetect as the first level subdirectory of the template relative to the project's root path.
E.g., the template `./src/views/index.html` has the watching path of `./src`.

- `includes` - Watch the files specified in `paths`, except `excludes`, that match the regular expressions.
Defaults, are watched only files that match the [`test`](/plugin-options-test) plugin option.

- `excludes` - Exclude the specified paths or files, that match the regular expressions.

This options does not override the default values, but extends them.

**Example**

All source files are in the `./src` directory,
while some partials included in a template are in `./vendor/` directory, then add it to the `paths`.

If you want watch changes in some special files used in your template that are only loaded through the template engine,
add them to the `includes` property.

```js
const HtmlBundlerPlugin = require('html-bundler-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new HtmlBundlerPlugin({
      entry: {
        index: 'src/views/index.html',
      },
      watchFiles: [
        paths: ['vendor'],
        includes: [
          /data\/.+\.(js|json)$/, // watch all JSON or JS files in the `vendor/data/` directory
          /docs\/.+\.md$/, // watch all MD files in the `vendor/docs/` directory
        ],
      ],
    }),
  ],
};
```

**In this example:**\
When any `.json` or `.js` file in `vendor/data/` or any `.md` file in `vendor/docs/` changes,
the plugin triggers a rebuild and updates the output.

To exclude watching of files defined in `paths` and `includes`, you can use the `excludes` option.
This option has the priority over `paths` and `includes`.

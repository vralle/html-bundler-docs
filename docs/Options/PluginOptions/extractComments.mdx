# Extract comments

Option: `extractComments`

Type: `boolean` Default: `false`

Whether comments shall be extracted to a separate file like the `*.LICENSE.txt`.

By default, the built-in Webpack plugin `TerserWebpackPlugin` extracts the license banner from node modules into a separate `*.LICENSE.txt` file,
although this is usually not necessary.

Therefore, by default, the Bundler Plugin does not allow extracting comments.
This has the same effect as explicitly defining the `extractComments: false` option of the TerserWebpackPlugin.

If you want to allow extraction of `*.LICENSE.txt` files, set this option to `true`.

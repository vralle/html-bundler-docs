# Callback postprocess

Option: `postprocess`

Type:

```ts
type postprocess = (
  content: string,
  info: TemplateInfo,
  compilation: Compilation
) => string | undefined;

type TemplateInfo = {
  name: string;
  assetFile: string;
  sourceFile: string;
  resource: string;
  outputPath: string;
};
```

Default: `null`

Called after the template has been compiled, but not yet finalized, before injection of the split chunks and inline assets.

The `postprocess` have the following arguments:

- `content: string` - a content of processed file
- `info: TemplateInfo` - info about current file
- `compilation: Compilation` - the Webpack [compilation object](https://webpack.js.org/api/compilation-object/)

The `TemplateInfo` have the following properties:

- `name: string` - the entry name
- `assetFile: string` - the output asset filename relative to `outputPath`
- `sourceFile: string` - the absolute path of the source file, without a query
- `resource: string` - the absolute path of the source file, including a query
- `outputPath: string` - the absolute path of the output directory

Return new content as a `string`.
If return `undefined`, the result processed via Webpack plugin is ignored and will be saved a result processed via the loader.

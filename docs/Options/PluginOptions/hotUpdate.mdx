# hotUpdate

Option: `hotUpdate`

Type: `boolean` Default: `false`

If the value is `true`, then in the `serve` or `watch` mode, the `hot-update.js` file is injected into each generated HTML file to enable the live reloading.
Use this options only if you don't have a referenced source file of a script in template.

> :::note
>
> The `devServer.hot` must be `true`.

If you already have a JS file in HTML, this setting should be `false` as Webpack automatically injects the hot update code into the compiled JS file.

Also see [Setup Live Reload](#setup-live-reload).
